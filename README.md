# Atlassian Add-on using Express

Congratulations! You've successfully created an Atlassian Connect Add-on using the Express web application framework.

## What's next?

[Read the docs](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-connect-express/src/master/README.md#markdown-header-install-dependencies).

I've come across a beautiful tutorial which explains along with the screenshots what needs to be done in order to install the addon! Here's the link:
https://developer.atlassian.com/server/hipchat/getting-started-with-atlassian-connect-express/

Here's what you should do:
- Start with "Prerequisites" section
- Skip "Create a new add-on project" section
- Go through the whole "Start the add-on" section
- Instead of "Install the add-on in HipChat" section, choose this one

If you don't have "Upload add-on" link in there, click on the "Settings" link under the add-ons list on the "Manage Add-ons" page and check "Enable Private Listings" & "Enable Development Mode" checkboxes and refresh the page
